// Array of objects containing quotes
// Use a handler that is called when two buttons are pressed
// It will fetch a object based of index count
// Count increased when right arrow is selected
// Count is descresed when left arrow is selected
// Count must stay between 0 and last index
// Handler returns the object from array
// Html is then used to format the quote
