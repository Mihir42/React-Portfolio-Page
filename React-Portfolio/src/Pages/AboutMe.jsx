            Hi, I'm Mihir! I recently graduated from Kingston University with a
            Computer Science BSc Hons. My passion for tech led me to
            programming, and during my degree, I focused on building web apps in
            ReactJS because I want to be able to do XY Z one day.

            My favourite thing about being a dev is the constant state of
            growth. It's those breakthrough moments, after you've been getting
            your a** handed to you over and over again, that I love the most!
            I'm excited to learn in an awesome team to do that even faster. I
            would love to use my skills to insert something authentic and
            honest.
          </p>

            I have some experience with Agile methodologies and thrive on the
            challenges of being stretched as a developer. I‚Äôm a super patient,
            easy going guy and I'm excited for my next role.
