            Ello, I'm Mihir! I am a recent Computer Science graduate from
            Kingston University. My long interest in computers has led me down
            the route of programming. During University I developed a range of
            applications which you can read about below. I am a bit of a nerd
            when it comes to technology especially computer hardware.

            My favourite thing about being a dev is the constant state of
            growth. There are many tough hair pulling moments, usually
            complimented by big breakthroughs during debugging, that I love the
            most! I'm excited to learn in an awesome team and contribute to a
            real world application. I would love to use my skills to insert
            something authentic and honest.
